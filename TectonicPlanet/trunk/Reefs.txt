Although corals are found both in temperate and tropical waters, shallow-water reefs are formed only in a zone extending at most from 30°N to 30°S of the equator.
Tropical corals do not grow at depths of over 50 m (165 ft).
Temperature has less of an effect on the distribution of tropical coral, but it is generally accepted that they do not exist in waters below 18 °C, and that the optimum temperature is 26-27° Celsius for most coral reefs.
The reefs in the Persian gulf however have coral adapted to changing temperatures of 13° Celsius in winter and 38° Celsius in summer, thus having significantly colder and hotter ambient environments respectively than most coral reefs.

Sadly it also needs to be limited by ocean currents, otherwise the coral gets eroded, sand deposits around the shore, and more coral grows on it, eventually growing whole continents of coral.
The sand needs to be swept away and redeposited by ocean currents.
