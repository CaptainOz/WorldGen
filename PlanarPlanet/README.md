About
-----
Generates a planetary height map by randomly casting planes through the planet
and either increasing the height on one side of the plane and decreasing it on
the other.

Pros
----
 - Deceptively simple algorithm
 - Can generate geometry of any resolution
 - Geometry entirely based of seed number, can regenerate it just from that.

Cons
----
 - Despite the name, the geometry is very mountainous and bumpy.
